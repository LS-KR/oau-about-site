Shu is our Executive Director. She is in charge of the inter-communication of One Among Us. She likes being with people. She is not a good cook and we warned you not to eat her cooking.

## Vapaa (they/she)

Vapaa is a member of Trans in Academia. They primarily work on the Uniguide project. When approaching them, it's advisable to approach them gently. Abrupt interactions may startle them, and you will see them jump in fright (literally).
