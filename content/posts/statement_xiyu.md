# Statement on the Recent Infringement Controversy of the "Translation/Selected" Series Accounts and Our Relationship with Its Operator, the "Xiyu" Group

1. Since May 2023, "Xiyu" has entrusted One Among Us ("our organization" hereinafter) to manage its public affairs. However, during the management process, it did not disclose to us the details of its operation (such as criticism of it, and user blocking rules, etc.), which led the directors of our organization to make a wrong judgment of the incident and issue unclear statements with one of them's personal account. We apologize for not having detailed information of the operations of the team supervised by us.

2. After this incident, our organization immediately proposed to "remove all content on Mastodon that the author did not authorize to reproduce, issue a public apology, and publish the operation situation" as a recommendation to rectify the situation. However, after our first contact, "Xiyu" still refused to accept our rectification suggestions, and did not clean up all unauthorized reprinted content and delete the number in time, and its Mastodon account has been blocked by *m.cmx.im*. We regret and lament this practice of "Xiyu" and its result.

3. Except for the above public affairs and supervision, the accounts and operations of our organization and "Xiyu" are completely separate. Our organization does not have the authority to access the admin authority of any of the public SNS accounts of "Xiyu", nor does it have the ability to respond in a timely manner. Again, this was a mistake on the part of our organization, and we apologize for it.

4. As a result of the above, our organization is no longer capable of supervising and managing the public affairs of the "Translation/Selected" accounts. Therefore, with immediate effect, our organization is relieved of its affiliation with the "Xiyu" team. Once again, we apologize profusely to the creators and the public involved in this matter. We have always emphasized respect for the rights of creators to express themselves and for community rules in online communities such as Fediverse, and we will continue to do so in our future work. We will reflect deeply on this mistake and try to avoid such mistakes in our future work. In particular, we apologize to Ms. Ai Daxun on Douban, and to @ziwendong on Fediverse, who was concerned about this matter.

## One Among Us 关于近期长毛象「翻译/精选」账号侵权争议，及与其运营者「细雨」工作组关系的声明

1. 2023年5月起，「细雨」委托 One Among Us（下称「我机构」）管理其公共事务。然而，在管理过程中，其没有向我们透露详细的运营情况（如对其的批评意见，以及 block 用户的策略等），导致我机构负责人做出对事件的错误判断，以个人名义发布了并不清晰的声明。在此为我们没有掌握下级督导机构的全部运营情况而郑重道歉。

2. 此次事件之后，我机构立即提出「在长毛象上删除所有著作者未授权转载的内容，发布公开道歉声明，公布运营情况」的督导整改建议。然而，「细雨」在我们第一时间的再三联络之下，仍然拒绝接受我们的整改建议，没有全部清理非授权转载内容并及时删号，其长毛象账号已经被长毛象中文主站封禁。我们对「细雨」的这一做法及其结果表示遗憾和惋惜。

3. 除了以上公共事务和督导之外，我机构和「细雨」的账目和运营都是完全分离的。我机构并未掌握「细雨」任何公共平台账号的管理权限，也没有办法及时响应。这同样是我机构的工作失误，在此表示郑重道歉。

4. 综上所述，我机构现在已经没有能力对翻译/精选账号进行督导和公共事务管理。因此，即日起我机构解除与翻译/精选小组的挂靠关系。我们再次对这件事情中涉及的创作者和公众表示深刻道歉。我们一贯强调尊重创作者的权利表达，在各 Fediverse 等网络社群中尊重社群规定，并且在之后的工作中将会持续对这一点的坚持。这次的失误我们将深刻反省，并且会在之后的工作中尽力避免此类错误。尤其是对被伤害到的豆瓣友邻艾大荀女士，以及关心此事的子文东老师表示诚恳道歉。
