# *Citrus and Lilium* Spotlights Challenges of Transgender Medical Care in China with Subtitled Video

Toronto, Ontario, Canada - May 29, 2023 - The video titled “The Underground Railroad of Transgender Medical Care in China” produced by the Chinese transgender-friendly queer YouTube channel *Citrus and Lilium* is now re-released with English subtitles. The video sheds light on the significant obstacles faced by Chinese transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in accessing gender affirmation hormonal therapy and invites English-speaking audiences to listen to their voices and experiences.

*Citrus and Lilium* has released a poignant and informative video that reveals the challenges faced by transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in China when seeking medical care related to their gender identity. By providing English subtitles, the video aims to break down language barriers and raise awareness among international audiences about the unique struggles experienced by the Chinese transgender community.

“We are excited to share the insightful video, ‘The Underground Railroad of Transgender Medical Care in China,’ produced by ‘Citrus and Lilium,’” said Yvette, Director of One Among Us Transgender Support. “It allows us to bring the voices of Chinese transgender and gender non-conforming individuals to English-speaking audiences, fostering understanding and empathy while promoting positive change.”

The subtitled video showcases the complex and often daunting journey that Chinese transgender individuals must undertake to access gender-affirming hormonal therapy.
